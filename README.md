## You have little time remaining

The game is centered around your constantly dimming light. Your light will only last 60 seconds. Collecting light from light sources can extend your light's lifespan... for a little while anyway.

## Watch where you are in the dark...

Terrible souls dwell in the darkness of Minute to Midnight, if you're not careful, they can take your light away in a single blow.
